## 👋 Hi, I'm Kruthika — MSc Electronics 

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm currently pursuing my Master’s in Electronics at the University of Southampton. I work at the intersection of **hardware design** and **machine learning**, with a strong focus on building innovative and practical systems.

🛠️ *MATLAB*  
Implemented and compared three estimation techniques for nonlinear dynamic systems as part of control and sensor fusion coursework.

### Monte Carlo Simulation for Vaccine Inventory Optimization  
🛠️ *MATLAB, Receding Horizon Method*  
Simulated vaccine demand using inventory constraints and stochastic variation, optimized supply with expectation-based control.

###  Adaptive Filter on FPGA *(Target: June 2025)* 
🛠️ *SystemVerilog, FPGA, MATLAB*  
Goal: Implement LMS-based real-time adaptive filtering for noise cancellation.
